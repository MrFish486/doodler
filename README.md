# doodler
A canvas based game.

I used to know this browser based game that had a black background, and you would draw little things in white, and they would come to life.

It was likely created before 2020, but after 2010. Other people could also log on and create doodles with your doodles.

It seemed like there was an infinite amount of space for the doodles to go. I remember it was in black in white, and it was not competitive; there were no ways to win or compete.

The art was hand drawn, and the creatures moved by themselves. You could scroll to each side as much as you want, to find a space for your doodles to stay in.

There was only one canvas, and it was scrolling, and everybody could interact with it. I could not find out what it was called, but I was inspired by it, so I made my own version.
